Hello, I am a master student in Central China Normal University (CCNU), majoring in Theoretical Physics. Before joining CCNU, I got my bacholar degree in Northeast Normal University, majoring in Physics.

My research interests include QCD and LQCD, dividing in exploring questions in the aspect of QCD by using Lattice method.
